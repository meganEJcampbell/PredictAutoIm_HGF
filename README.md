## PredictAutoIm_HGF
This the paradigm and analysis code for an experiment on automatic imitation behaviour under different conditions of predictability. Analysis focuses on computational modelling of precision weighted learning to provide insight into the behavioural effects (reaction time differences between congruent and incongruent trials), and comparing Rescorla-Wagner (RW) to hierachical perceptual-response models that incorporate beliefs about levels of uncertainty (Hierachical Gaussain Filter). HGF implemented with TAPAS toolbox: see https://github.com/translationalneuromodeling/tapas
